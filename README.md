# Vostok 1

### üë©‚ÄçüöÄ Simple wireframe to create robust pages on different frameworks. Bem elements on Stylus for a fast start with Angular or Pug or simple HTML/CSS project.

Vostok 1 is a simple collection of elements wrote on [Stylus](http://stylus-lang.com/) with [BEM-notation](https://en.bem.info/). You can think about it like a starter Kit for most boring and repeated operation in page creation. It's like bootstrap, but very simple and create for advanced uses with Angular or self-created pages with Pug or whatever you use. On this page you can see all elements with code description.

## How I can start use it?

You can copy files from `/src/styl/` folder on GitHub repo in you project ‚Äî that's all. All other code with Gulp and styles added only for create this GitHub page. It's not a part of Vostok 1 but you can read it if you want some example. 

**Note:** on this page use [reset.css](https://github.com/shannonmoeller/reset-css) created by Eric Meyer. This is not good practice for vanila BEM, but it's normal for fast develop. Alternatively you can use [PostCSS plugin](https://github.com/maximkoretskiy/postcss-initial) for reset styles, but be careful with style's order.
